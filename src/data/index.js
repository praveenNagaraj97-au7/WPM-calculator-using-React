  "Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark",
  "Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments client, server, and native, and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.",
